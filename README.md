Travelkuy is a web application that allows users to book travel packages in the Bali region. The application leverages various advanced technologies, including Tailwind CSS, Ant Design, Daisy, Formik, Yup, Axios, and Tanstack Query.

## Core Technologies

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A CSS framework that allows developers to rapidly build stylish web layouts.

- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/): A UI design library that enables developers to easily use pre-built components.

- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/): A UI plugin for Tailwind CSS that helps you create cool layouts.

- [Formik](https://formik.org/): A library for managing forms in React with ease.

- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup): A data validation library for JavaScript.

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/): A library for making HTTP requests with ease.

- [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query): A library for managing data requests in React applications.

## Installation

   ```

3. Install all dependencies.

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the application.

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

The application will run at `http://localhost:3000`.




First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
